# Monster-Cock-Builder

MonsterCocks Art NFT.

MCK short for MonsterCocks is a Non-Fungible-Token (NFT) based around people's infatuation with monster cocks. MCK is the world's largest collection of digital cocks, and anyone can get their hands on one. MonsterCocks is fully unique once minted, and can never be destroyed. Each MCK is built uniquely using multiple random values. You will never find a Cock that is the same, similar but never the same.

Some of the unique attributes that make up a MosterCock are:
- Colors: The colors of the Cock.
- Background: The patterns and colors that make up the background.
- Names: Each Cock has a unique name that will never repeat.

Each MonsterCock is a one-of-a-kind NFT!!! You can view the source code behind the generation of MCKs at https://github.com/james-garfield/Monster-Cock-Builder.

# Monster-Cock-Builder Outline

Monster Cock Builder was originally written in Python, but was ported to Rust for performance reasons.
Although MCKB is stable, it is still in development. Original Python code can be found within previous commits.
MCKB contains 4 main components:
- src/: This is the main program that generates MCKs.
- model/: This is the model that is used to validate MCKs schemas.
- notebooks/: A playground for testing machine learning models.
- data/: A collection of data that is used to generate MCKs. Also contains the monstercocks once generated.
- scripts/: Batch scripts. Find out more within each script.

## TODO:
- Generate MCKs from JSON.
- Convert schema methods to nannou.
- Better CLI output.
